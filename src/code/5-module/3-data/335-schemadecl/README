# Schema Declarations

This module provides a set of functions for use by schema declaration files.

The def_ functions are for defining new schema elements, and the mod_ functions are for modifying
existing elements.

Elements are modelled in a linked list of MudSchemaDecl nodes. Later processing applies each
MudSchemaDecl node to a schema definition to take the modelling process to the next phase.
