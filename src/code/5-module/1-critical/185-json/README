== Mudball JSON module ==

The JSON module is for:

* data encoding and decoding using the JSON format

=== mud_json_pretty() ===

This will do a standard pretty-print encode. This is usually used for human/programmer consumption.

=== mud_json_compact() ===

This will do a standard compact encode, no pretty-printing. This is the best choice for storage.

=== mud_json_ascii() ===

This will do a standard compact ASCII encode, no pretty-printing. Unicode characters will be
escaped. This is suitable when you need to transmit through an ASCII medium.

=== mud_json_embed() ===

This will do a compact encode suitable for inclusion in JavaScript or HTML documents. Importantly
this function will escape backslash characters which means no malicious or accidental
"</script>" content can create problems.

=== mud_json_decode() ===

This will decode JSON using associative arrays (not objects) where necessary.
