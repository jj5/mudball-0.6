= Mud Retry =

This module provides some functions which will retry an operation a number of times until it
either succeeds or exceeds its retry count. The purpose of these functions is to provide some
resilience and robustness when integrating with unreliable external systems which can
intermittently fail, such as the file system.

See the 'file' and 'directory' modules for example usage of this module.

== mud_retry() ==

This function will retry an operation a number of times and return false on failure and otherwise
on success.

== mud_require() ==

This function will retry an operation a number of times and throw an exception if the operation
does not complete within the allowed number of retries.
