= Actions =

Actions are how facilities do work. They handle POST submissions. The class name and the action
name are one and the same and should be all capitals such as:

$default = [ yes => 'DEFAULT', no => '' ];

$channel = one of [ cli, web ]

$type = facility type

ACTION _ $default _ $channel _ $type _ $entity _ $verb

Actions should have a version number, starting at 1 and incrementing upon each change to the
implementation. Hmm. This needs thought. Maybe we only bump version for breaking changes? Or
maybe we implement full semver for each action?

ACTION_DEFAULT_WEB_LOGIN

ACTION_WEB_ADMIN_USER_ADD

ACTION_WEB_API_SUBSCRIBE

ACTION_CLI_CONSOLIDATE_DATA

Note: 'default' implementations are bundled with Mud Ball. If overriding the action remove
'default' from the action name. You can do e.g.:

class ACTION_WEB_LOGIN extends ACTION_DEFAULT_WEB_LOGIN { ... }

They just replace the 'action' input in your HTML <form> to be e.g. ACTION_WEB_LOGIN

At the moment we're just gonna have one big long list of ACTION* classes in

src / code / 5-action /

But in future we might tidy this up with support for subdirectories, viz

src / code / 5-action / [ cli, web ] / [ api, admin, util, ... ] / ...
