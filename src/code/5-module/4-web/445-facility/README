= Facilities =

Types of facilities:

* api (for automated external access)
* dev (tools for developers)
* admin (tools for system administrators)
* util (login, logout, etc)
* content (content is the main game for your service content)
* ... (you can introduce facility types if you wish)

The robots.txt file should block search engines for everything except 'content'.

Disallow: /api
Disallow: /dev
...

The web controller should have some semantics attached to facility types:

* dev only available in DEV builds
* admin only available to users in the ADMIN role

Facility implementation file path:

$type = one of [ api, dev, admin, util, content, ... ]

src / code / 6-facility / $type / $entity / $verb / $type_$entity_$verb.php

or you can be deeper than simple $entity / $verb, as with e.g.

src / code / 6-facility / $type / album / track-list / edit / $type_album_track_list_edit.php

Your Mud Ball application will automatically find and load your facilities based on their
location in your project based on the above naming convention.

But you can have even simpler facilities with just a verb, e.g.

src / code / 6-facility / util / login / util_login.php

Verbs can be e.g.:

* index
* list
* view
* edit
* add
* delete
* login
* logout
* ...
