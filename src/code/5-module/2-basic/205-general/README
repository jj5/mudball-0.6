== Mudball general module ==

The general module is for:

* process initialization
* inferring variable/column types
* generic retry logic

=== mud_init() ===

Call mud_init() to setup your PHP environment before you run your main code. You should call
mud_init() *after* you have loaded your own config file because you might want to set some of the
debug constants in your config file before mud_init() sets them to default values.

The mud_init() function will:

# enable error reporting for all errors
# configure I/O and other subsystems to use UTF-8
# configure the locale // 2021-02-25 jj5 - hardcoded to en_AU.UTF8 presently
# parse standard command-line args // 2021-02-25 jj5 - these will be expanded
# make sure standard constants are defined if not already

=== mud_is_bool_name() ===

This will determine if a variable/field is a boolean based on its name. Basically it checks for
'is', 'has', 'was', 'can', and 'should' prefixes in various formats. See code for details.

=== mud_retry() ===

This will retry a function a number of times before giving up.
