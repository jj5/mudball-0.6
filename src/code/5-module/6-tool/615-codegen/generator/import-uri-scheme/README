This scripot will pick up changes in the list of URI schemes maintained here:

  https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml

and then do some code generation for a few files, see the 'gen' directory for specifics.

Note: we used to parse the XHTML file above, but since then we have discovered a CSV file which
we now use instead.

I don't want to run this script too frequently and will not put it in the default build scripts.

2022-02-21 jj5 - THINK: we still need to figure out how to update the schema migration scripts
if the URI Scheme data changes due to new URIs.

If you're debugging this script you can use the --debug flag to reuse the existing CSV file
without downloading a fresh copy. You can use the --quiet flag to disable verbose output.
