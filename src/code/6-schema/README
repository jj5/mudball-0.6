= mudballdb =

So this is the definition for the basic schema that comes with the framework. The mudball schema
items are in the 'std' namespace, and your application schema items will typically be in the 'app'
namespace.

== Upgrades ==

At the present time upgrades are not well supported. Not all the functionality that was developed
in PHPBOM was migrated to Mudball, particularly not all the support for schema upgrades. I will
add the support for schema upgrades as it becomes necessary. Some fairly significant technical
debt, granted.

== Logs ==

Note: logs have enforced foreign key constraints and for this reason cannot reference entity
data directly as that entity data me get deleted. If you need to log information about entity
data you can do so by using the history ID for the entity in question. You need to get the
relevant history ID that you will put into the log before you commit your TRN transaction and
write the log after you have committed your TRN transaction.
